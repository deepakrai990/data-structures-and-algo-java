### Q1. Minimum largest element
#### Problem Description
```text
Given an array A of N numbers, you have to perform B operations. In each operation, you 
have to pick any one of the N elements and add the original value(value stored at 
the index before we did any operations) to its current value. You can choose any of 
the N elements in each operation.

Perform B operations in such a way that the largest element of the 
modified array(after B operations) is minimized.

Find the minimum possible largest element after B operations.
```
#### Problem Constraints
```text
1 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= B <= 10^5
-10^5 <= A[i] <= 10^5
```
#### Input Format
```text
The first argument is an integer array A.
The second argument is an integer B.
```
#### Output Format
```text
Return an integer denoting the minimum possible largest element after B operations.
```
#### Example Input
```text
Input 1:
 A = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
 B = 3

Input 2:
 A = [5, 1, 4, 2] 
 B = 5
```
#### Example Output
```text
Output 1:
 4

Output 2:
 5
```
#### Example Explanation
```text
Explanation 1:
    Apply operation on element at index 0, the array would change to [2, 2, 3, 4]
    Apply operation on element at index 0, the array would change to [3, 2, 3, 4]
    Apply operation on element at index 0, the array would change to [4, 2, 3, 4]
    Minimum possible largest element after 3 operations is 4.

Explanation 2:
    Apply operation on element at index 1, the array would change to [5, 2, 4, 2]
    Apply operation on element at index 1, the array would change to [5, 3, 4, 2]
    Apply operation on element at index 1, the array would change to [5, 4, 4, 2]
    Apply operation on element at index 1, the array would change to [5, 5, 4, 2]
    Apply operation on element at index 3, the array would change to [5, 5, 4, 4]
    Minimum possible largest element after 5 operations is 5.
```
### Hints
* Hint 1
```text
Consider the current and the next value of every element of an array.
How can we pick the best possible element so that the largest element is minimized?
Will using a min-heap of the next states of the elements of an array help?
```
* Solution Approach
```text
Letâ€™s keep a state array to keep track of the value of every element in the 
array after K operations.

Maintain a state array, which tells about the state of the array after every operation.

Initially, the state array will be the same as the initial array.

We need to consider the next state of every element in the array.
Consider a min-heap. And initially push the next state of every element in the heap.

Note that you need to keep track of the indices of every element in the heap, 
present in the initial array.

Pick the top element, and change the state of that element in the state array.

Pop this element and push the next state in the heap.
At every operation, we are choosing the element whose next state is minimum hence 
there are only two possibilities:
    
    1) Either the maximum element remains the same, and we return that element directly.
    
    2) The next state of the popped element is the maximum.

We made sure changing the state of this element is the best option, as the next state 
of this element is the minimum.

Hence the maximum will be the least using this approach.
