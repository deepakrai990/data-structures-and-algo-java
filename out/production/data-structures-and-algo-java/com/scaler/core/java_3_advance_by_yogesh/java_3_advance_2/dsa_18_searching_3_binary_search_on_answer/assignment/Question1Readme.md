### Q1. Painter's Partition Problem

<p>Given 2 integers <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> 
and an array of integers <strong>C</strong> of size 
<strong>N</strong>. Element <strong>C[i]</strong> represents 
the length of <strong>i<sup>th</sup></strong> board.<br> You 
have to paint all <strong>N</strong> boards 
<strong>[C<sub>0</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, 
C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub> â€¦ C<sub>N-1</sub>]</strong>. 
There are <strong>A</strong> painters available and each of 
them takes <strong>B</strong> units of time to paint 
<strong>1 unit</strong> of the board.</p>

#### Problem Description
```text
Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
NOTE:
1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.

Return the ans % 10000003.
```
#### Problem Constraints
* <p>1 &lt;= A &lt;= 1000</p>
* <p>1 &lt;= B &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></p>
* <p>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></p>
* <p>1 &lt;= C[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></p>
```text
1 <= A <= 1000
1 <= B <= 10^6
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= C[i] <= 10^6
```
#### Input Format
```text
The first argument given is the integer A.
The second argument given is the integer B.
The third argument given is the integer array C.
```
#### Output Format
```text
Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the 
constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous 
sections of board % 10000003.
```
#### Example Input
```text
Input 1:
 A = 2
 B = 5
 C = [1, 10]

Input 2:
 A = 10
 B = 1
 C = [1, 8, 11, 3]
```
#### Example Output
```text
Output 1:
 50
Output 2:
 11
```
#### Example Explanation
```text
Explanation 1:
    Possibility 1:- One painter paints both blocks, time 
    taken = 55 units.
    
    Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 
    paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
    
    There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
    ans = 50 % 10000003

Explanation 2:
    
    Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 
    paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3 
    and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11
    ans = 11 % 10000003
```
### Hints
* Hint 1
```text
Hint: Think binary search for the answer.

If you had a function bool isPossible which could tell 
you if it is possible to paint the boards in time T or 
less, can you solve the problem?
```
* Solution Approach
```text
You are already halfway there if you have already solved 
the problem corresponding to hint1.

You can do a binary search for the answer :

  start = 0, end = max_time_possible
  mid = (start + end) / 2
  if isPossible(mid): 
      end = mid - 1
  else 
    start = mid + 1

Now, let us look into how isPossible would be implemented.

Keep assigning boards to painter greedily till the time 
taken < mid, if you run out of painters, isPossible = false.
else isPossible = true.
