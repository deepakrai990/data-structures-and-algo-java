     * Q4. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks I
     * <p>
     * Problem Description
     * Say you have an array, A, for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
     * If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock),
     * design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
     * <p>
     * Return the maximum possible profit.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Problem Constraints
     * 0 <= len(A) <= 7e5
     * 1 <= A[i] <= 1e7
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Input Format
     * The first and the only argument is an array of integers, A.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Output Format
     * Return an integer, representing the maximum possible profit.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Example Input
     * Input 1:
     * A = [1, 2]
     * Input 2:
     * <p>
     * A = [1, 4, 5, 2, 4]
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Example Output
     * Output 1:
     * 1
     * Output 2:
     * <p>
     * 4
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Example Explanation
     * Explanation 1:
     * Buy the stock on day 0, and sell it on day 1.
     * Explanation 2:
     * <p>
     * Buy the stock on day 0, and sell it on day 2.

     * Scaler Solution
     * Approach
     *
     * Hint 1
     * Basically you need to find the maximum value of A[j]-A[i] where j>i.
     * Now can you do this?
     *
     * Solution Approach
     * If you buy your stock on day i, youâ€™d obviously want to sell it on the day its price is maximum after that day.
     * So essentially at every index i, you need to find the maximum in the array in the suffix.
     * Now this part can be done in 2 ways :
     * 1) Have another array which stores that information.
     * max[i] = max(max[i+1], A[i])
     *
     * 2) Start processing entries from the end maintaining a maximum till now. Constant additional space requirement.
     * Above solution is same
