### Q7. Dynamic Arrays
#### Problem Description
```text
What is the Time Complexity of adding elements in Dynamic Arrays?
```

#### Options
```text
1. O(1)
2. O(1) amortized
3. O(logN)
4. O(N)
```
* Complete Solution
```text
On average it takes O(1) to add but  when the array expands 
in size it takes O(N) time to make the new array and then 
add an element.

Hence, the time complexity of adding elements in a dynamic array
is O(1) amortized. 
```
