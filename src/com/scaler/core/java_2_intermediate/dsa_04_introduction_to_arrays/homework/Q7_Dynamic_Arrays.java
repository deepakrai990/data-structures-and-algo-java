     * Q7. Dynamic Arrays
     *
     * What is the Time Complexity of adding elements in Dynamic Arrays?
     *
     * Scaler Solution
     * On average it takes O(1) to add but  when
     * the array expands in size it takes O(N) time
     * to make the new array and then add an element.
     * Hence, the time complexity of adding elements in a dynamic array
     * is O(1) amortized.
     *
     * Answer : O(1) amortized
