### What is Time Complexity Analysis ?

Whenever we are thinking of a solution to a problem, there can 
be N number of solutions. For instance, any problem can be 
solved in multiple different ways. But the Question that arises 
here is, how can we recognise the most efficient solution if we 
have a set of different solutions?

To answer this question let us understand - What is Time Complexity?
