### Q2. DSA - 01
#### Problem Description
```text
An algorithm consists of two independent piece of code, having 
complexities f(n) and g(n) respectively. What would be the 
complexity of the complete algorithm
```
#### Options
```text
1. f(n) x g(n)
2. MAX( f(n), g(n) )
3. MIN ( f(n), g(n) )
4. f(n) + g(n)
```

* Complete Solution
```text
2. MAX( f(n), g(n) )
```
