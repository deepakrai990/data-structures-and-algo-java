### Q3. Largest Distance between nodes of a Tree
#### Problem Description
```text
Find largest distance Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which 
consists of N (2 <= N <= 40000) nodes.

The goal of the problem is to find largest distance between two nodes in a tree. 
Distance between two nodes is a number of edges on a path between the 
nodes (there will be a unique path between any pair of nodes since it is a tree).

The nodes will be numbered 0 through N - 1.

The tree is given as an array A, there is an edge between nodes A[i] 
and i (0 <= i < N). Exactly one of the i's will have A[i] equal to -1, it will be root node.
```
#### Problem Constraints
```text
2 <= |A| <= 40000
```
#### Input Format
```text
First and only argument is vector A
```
#### Output Format
```text
Return the length of the longest path
```
#### Example Input
```text
Input 1:
 A = [-1, 0]

Input 2: 
 A = [-1, 0, 0]
```
#### Example Output
```text
Output 1:
 1

Output 2:
 2
```
#### Example Explanation
```text
Explanation 1:
    Path is 0 -> 1.

Explanation 2:
    Path is 1 -> 0 -> 2.
```
### Hints
* Hint 1
```text
How would you solve the problem if you knew the longest path certainly goes through root?
Try to generalize this approach for other nodes.
You may think of how traversal algorithms such as DFS and BFS might help you
solve this.
```
* Solution Approach
```text
1) pick any node u

2) find the node which is farthest from u, call it x (calculate using the same approach 
   as in Solution 1)

3) find the node which is farthest from x, call it q (calculate using the same approach 
   as in Solution 1)

The answer will be the length of a path from x to q.

Proof of correctness:

The crucial step is to prove that x will be one of the endpoints of the path with 
maximal length (note that there might be more than one such path). If it is, then 
the longest path from x will be the longest path in the tree.

Let d(v1, v2) be length of path between v1 and v2

Letâ€™s prove it by contradiction: assume there is a strictly longer path between s and t, 
neither of which is x. Let h be a node which is closest to u among the nodes on a 
path between s and t. Then there are two cases:

1) h is on path between u and x

    u
    |
    |
    |
    h   x
   / \ /
  /   *
 /     \
s       t 
then d(s, t) = d(s, h) + d(h, t) <= d(s, h) + d(h, x) = d(s, x), which contradicts 
assumption.

2) h is not on path between u and x

    u
    |
    *---x
    |
    h
   / \
  /   \
 /     \
s       t
then

d(u, s) <= d(u, x) <= d(u, h) + d(h, x)
d(u, t) <= d(u, x) <= d(u, h) + d(h, x)

d(s, t) = d(s, h) + d(h, t)
= d(u, s) + d(u, t) - 2 d(u, h)
<= 2 d(h, x)

2 d(s, t) <= d(s, t) + 2 d(h, x)
= d(s, h) + d(h, x) + d(x, h) + d(h, t)
= d(x, s) + d(x, t)

This means that max(d(v, s), d(v, t)) >= d(s, t), which also contradicts assumption.

Thus, we proved that farthest node of a node will be one of the endpoints of the 
longest path.
